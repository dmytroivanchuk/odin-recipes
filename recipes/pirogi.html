    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These pirogies can be boiled or fried in butter, which makes them tastier.
      Serve with sour cream or cottage cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>⅔ cup cold water</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>5 pounds baking potatoes</li>
      <li>1 pound bacon</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>¼ pound bacon</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) jar sauerkraut - drained, rinsed and minced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make dough: Combine flour, cold water, beaten egg, and salt in a bowl;
        mix until a smooth dough forms. Cover the bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make potato filling: Place potatoes in a large pot. Add water to cover,
        bring to a boil, and cook until tender, 25 to 35 minutes. Drain and mash
        in the pot until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
        occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices
        on paper towels. Crumble and stir into mashed potatoes. Stir in cheese;
        season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sauerkraut filling: Place bacon in the skillet and cook over
        medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10
        minutes. Drain, crumble, and place in a medium bowl. Stir in sauerkraut,
        then sour cream. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/8- to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut
        out 3-inch circles with a cookie cutter or an upside-down drinking
        glass. Place a spoonful of potato or sauerkraut filling in the center of
        each circle and fold over, pinching edges together to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; drop perogies in
        boiling water and cook until they float, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
